### Learning is fun
#If you want to know more about markdowns and personal GitHub pages, you've found it!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/codywoody10/portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Here, I'm attempting to insert a link to a City of Tucson StoryMap about the [Santa Cruz River Heritage](https://arcg.is/1O5j44) and hopefully it works. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Cody is da bomb
## Things will show up here when you edit the README
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/codywoody10/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

I used Jekyll to find my Leap Year theme, which is pretty cool.
